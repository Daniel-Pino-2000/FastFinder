# FastFinder

FastFinder is an app designed to search files and folders in the internal storage of a Windows computer. The app indexes the storage on the first run and allows users to perform searches with several powerful features.

---

## Features

- **Indexing on First Run**: On the first launch, FastFinder automatically indexes your files and folders in the background. Once the initial index is created, you can perform searches without waiting for the indexing process to complete.
  
- **Database Updates**: After the initial index, you can update the database. While the database is being updated, you can continue searching using the previously indexed data.

- **Custom Directory Search**: FastFinder allows users to perform custom searches in specific directories, even while indexing or updating the database.

- **Filters for Files and Folders**: You can filter your search results by files or folders.

- **Advanced File Filters**: When searching for files, you can apply additional filters to narrow down the search results, such as file type or size.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install FastFinder on your Windows machine:

### Prerequisites

- Windows Operating System
- .NET Framework (or other required dependencies depending on your app's requirements)

### Steps

1. **Download the latest release** from the [Releases page](https://github.com/your-username/FastFinder/releases).
2. **Extract the ZIP file** (if applicable) to a folder of your choice.
3. **Run the executable** `FastFinder.exe` to launch the application.

---

## Usage

1. On the **first launch**, FastFinder will start indexing your files and folders. This may take some time, depending on the size of your storage but a custom search can be performed while indexing.
2. Once the initial index is complete, you can begin performing searches on the database which will be way faster than a custom search.
3. To update the database, simply select the **Update Database** option from the menu. While updating, you can still search using the previously indexed data.
4. Use the **Custom Search** feature to search within specific directories. You can specify the folder you want to search in while indexing or updating the database.
